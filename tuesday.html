      The next morning came and S woke up early but pretended to be asleep just so she could enjoy the early morning sun and smell of the sheets. Ultimately she went back to that kind of sleep you have in lazy risings, when your mind is asking for more rest and immediately goes into a deep snoozing, returning to the dream you were having just a few minutes earlier.
  To S it was one where she and G are on their way to their favourite park, a big one near their old house. They walk there with their hammock, a bottle of white wine and olives. They make their way through the gardens and the forest, in between the trees that the sunlight contours, feet making music out of crushed dry leaves. And then they find the perfect set of trees and agree it’s the perfect set of trees. The hammock is hung and swings with the light wind of August. S and G lay in there, G opens her legs and S has hers on the side, each of their heads on one end of the hammock. S opens the bottle and pours some wine in the cups they brought. She looks up to the trees and the sun, closing her eyes. G turns her head to the side and kisses S’s feet: first her toes, and then gently while stroking the foot’s arch she keeps kissing until she gets to the ankle.
  <p></p>
  After waking up, S tries to go back to the dream, oh she wishes she could stay in that hammock until sunset. This a recurring a dream for S, a memory left on her mind that often fights to come back to the present, as if her brain was trying not to forget certain sensorial experiences, bodily responses not dependent on numbers, salaries, success. Her brain was trying not to forget her body and vice versa, I am my mind and my body at the same time, I don’t own anything, it is all my being. As if her body was begging for those goosebumps you have when you listen to a great song, to connections and conversations that you don’t get anything from but pleasure — a type of pleasure that is not like knowing you won best count of the month or being a woman CEO in the biggest energy company in the country.
  But for some women, being the CEO of the biggest energy company of the country makes them come like never before. It is not even comparable to the best orgasm you’ve had.
  For Sheryl, it means conquering a world that had been forever taken by men. And showing them she could be better better at it. Not only that, it meant helping more women going for the top, reaching their full potential.
  <p></p>

  Sheryl appears to be the ideal of the independent woman, one that doesn’t count on anyone but herself, one that knows that the ultimate power comes from individuals, that success is only real success if you fought for it blood sweat and tears on your own, needing no one. Needing another person, for Sheryl, is weakness. Needing another person is like waiting for Prince Charming. And the time when women waited around for Prince Charming is over, and so is waiting for Princess Charming. A true feminist, in Sheryl’s eyes, doesn't wait around for anyone and does not reach for help. Like a tiger, a true feminist doesn't ask, she takes.
  Dependence will eventually make you weaker. Dependence is womankind’s death. For centuries women have needed men to do too many things for them. Sheryl knows that we can only rely on ourselves. That’s when we are the most powerful — and yet, despite all this, there is another woman to whom Sheryl owes her success: Hillary Clinton. Also known as the President.
  Before Orgasmify, the country’s energy was state owned, sourced mostly by fossil fuels. Since it became no longer possible to use these, all sorts of different alternative energies had been explored either by the government or by other companies. Hillary had in the beginning defended the idea of sticking with a public energy management, but Sheryl’s Orgasmify was too good that it didn’t even take two words to convince Hillary. The thought of the competitiveness and efficiency was alluring, but what made the deal was the idea that finally Hillary would be able to prove and show the world the power of women’s energy. Quite literally. Sheryl and Hillary shared similar views of the world and female emancipation — they would see the end of the struggle with balancing work and personal life, pleasure and labour — the solution had come. Again, literally.
  By merging these elements in the ultimate reach of a woman’s potential, while using the long lost discoveries of Wilhem Reich on the orgasm, Hillary would gain the respect she deserves as this country’s best president ever. And womaness powers the nation. A nation, as dreamt by Reich, at last protected from totalitarianism: not only with orgasms but with free market.
  While making Sheryl and her billionaires.
  So the government put all the energy into Sheryl’s company; a small orgasm for a woman, a big orgasmic ecstasy for neoliberal womankind.

      <p>
        <p>
          <p>And remember, as I always say, it is the ultimate luxury to combine passion and contribution. Keep up the good work — but you don't need me tell you this. You have all the power in you to make this a better world while using your own pleasure.
            Let’s do this!</p>
        </p>
      </p>Sheryl finished her usual morning pep talk. She got in the car and drove headed to a meeting to catch up on with Hillary.
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>It seems that Orgasmify is doing brilliantly, Sheryl. Well done. I think we will be able to approve your proposal and soon 100% of the country’s energy supply will come out of love and orgasmic energy. This is brilliant!</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      Hillary ended the handshake by placing her left hand gently on Sheryl’s hand, as if she didn’t want to let go, as if she wanted to feel her soft hand more. They made eye contact and Sheryl pierced Hillary with her dark big eyes, eyes that wanted her.
      She quickly looked to the body guard standing behind her, a woman with ginger hair tied in a pony tail, with wide shoulders and hands behind her back. And then back to Hillary:
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>Thank you Hillary, I would not be able to do this without you. And of course you will have your part of the deal.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      Sheryl was now squeezing Hillary’s arm tight, the hand finding its way up from the handshake. The tightness said I want you, get the bodyguard out.

      <p>
        <p>
          <p>It is an absolute pleasure to do business with women like you, Sheryl. I am particularly looking forward to my bonus.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      She quirked a side smile, with horny eyes that wanted to sit her tight ass on her desk and spread her legs open right there. But a President must behave.

      <p>
        <p>
          <p>You will have it. In time. I should run back now, people are expecting me to be present at all times.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      Sheryl understood the cue, but a CEO must behave.
  She had to keep the objective, bodiless persona that had given her success.
  The motivational, strong, independent, rational and effective woman that got the job done.
  And yet these strange feelings came when she met Hillary, sensations that started in her toes, climbed her legs and up to her clitoris. A fire that went to her head and filled her skin with goosebumps. She forgot for so long the human touch, the pure and simple warmness of someone else’s skin against hers. Something her Orgasmify had never given her. Vulnerability.
  Sheryl looked down, which she rarely did, and left the room closing the door behind her.
  It didn’t take five seconds and her phone beeped with a message sound, it was Hillary.

      <p>
        <p>
          <p>Midnight at the park</p>
        </p>
      </p>that was all that it said.
