Being offered the chance of a lifetime in exploring your energy as a woman and making female history in energy production seems a dream come true: and yet it was S’s loneliest of times. It turned out Orgasmify’s competitive system had imposed that the norm is always to do your ancestor’s justice and to reach your full potential. You owe it to them. This competitiveness, no different from any other business, had both emancipated Orgasmify’s women but also individualise them: the close link they had established between their bodies and their capital had made them feel constantly anxious about their results and the response of their bodies. While the link body-capital was so strong it made the two merge into one, the link between themselves and their body was one of distance and not one of unity.
But oh how this was the empowerment dream: literal girl power. Powering the world.
S was working a shift with G when these thoughts swam in her mind like floating sea weed in a stormy winter day. Was there something out there that could be in between oppression and capitalist empowerment? S wondered if more women like Sheryl were out there searching for different business models. Different ways to think about business. There had to be something, right?
G reached a few orgasms and stood up to switch sides.
<p><p><p>You’re doing great, darling. So proud of you</p></p></p>. S pretended to had paid attention to G’s performance.
<p><p><p>Thanks, babe. Glad you’re my partner. Really. We finally have a job that will make a difference. Creating energy! Empowered women!</p></p></p> G was smiling, the corporate feminism had really gotten to her. She was getting off with capitalism. As S sat down and tried to relax with some breathing exercises in the Orgasmify as G continued: <p><p><p>You know I have been reading Sheryl’s new book, what a true Bible of female emancipation. It’s called <p><p><p>Really Really Lean In Right Now</p></p></p>. Awesome right? She is such a queen. I am thinking I might drop her office this weekend and ask her to sign it for me.</p></p></p>
Original title, S thought sarcastically. And as she finished her first orgasm, she turned to G:
<p><p><p>Speaking of weekend. Maybe we can take tomorrow off and go somewhere for a mini-holiday? Cabin in the woods, fire place, hot cocoa, enjoy a nice book, cuddle all morning… Saw this great place on Airbnb upstate that is available! And get out of here for a bit? Haven’t you had enough of Sheryl? Or worshiping her like some sort of corporate goddess?</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>Oh I’m sorry S… some of us don’t get enough of fucking female empowerment! How do you expect things to actually change if you lounging your ass in a woods cabin? Real work needs go get done.</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>What change? Is this fucking change? Cause it seems to me that’s pretty much the same shit.</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>Excuse me? You think having women producing this country’s energy is the same shit as it was before? Open your fucking eyes, S. Sheryl — and all of us, for that matter — is giving us the opportunity to reach our full potential as women, she’s putting female emancipation on the spot light. And things don't happen in a blink of an eye. You need to work for it. How can you go on holidays knowing that over here we are working so hard to make a difference?</p></p></p>
S took a deep breath.
<p><p><p>Look. I understand you want to make a difference and I do too. I really do. But I am just wondering if working like crazy as we are is helping anything. I feel tired. I need some rest. I am sure you do too. I am scared as well, I’m scared of failing and making mistakes. I’m constantly wondering if I am good enough, constantly comparing us to the nocturnals in our room. 	I know you are too. But I also want to do this right, I want to make all the women justice. I’m confused. Guess I just hoping we could re-charge for a bit.</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>Right. What if we take an Orgasmify to these woods? I’m sure they would be fine with that. And then we can have fun there and still produce!</p></p></p>
A wave of sadnesss stroke S like the biggest wave of the stormy winter. Now she wasn’t the sea weed drifting. She was just herself. Getting hit in the shore.
<p><p><p>You know what? Nevermind. This was a silly idea. Let’s just back to work, shall we? Don’t want to get behind in our numbers! Promised my mom I’d go back home for Christmas this year.</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>That’s the spirit, girl! Think of how lucky we are.</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>So, so lucky.</p></p></p>
S closed her eyes and let her mind go off somewhere else, let the day dreaming save her sanity.
She thought about a hot summer evening when all that she and G did was to kiss every single surface of each other body and run ice cubes through their bodies, one by one, until they disappeared in their pores and in the bed sheets. S remembers feeling pleasure like nothing she felt before. Or since then.

The sun had set when they finished their shift and they were starving. G suggested that she’d go down to the Orgasmaurant and grab them some take out to eat in their flat.
S agreed, she was craving a stir fry.
They walked opposite ways in the glass covered hallways of the building, S saw G disappear behind the lift door that closed.
S started walking towards their small studio, a few steps away from their Orgasmify room. Since she was alone, she decided to take a walk around. That had always helped her to clear her mind, and since she didn’t want to give G any more explanations about her apparent laziness, the Orgasmify was her best chance: she wouldn’t go far and it was big enough.
The glass walls made the lightbulb reflect in a way that you couldn’t tell the reflections and the objects apart, what was real and what was the projection. Some women were eating in the lounge chairs, some drinking smoothies and walking around. S noticed how she didn’t know half of the women here. Apart from G, there was hardly anyone she’d talk to, except for the occasional chit chat with the nocturnals in their shift change or in the rare company meetings that came with drinks afterwards. And even in those occasions, the air was always filled with a toxic atmosphere, an energy that kept the conversations as superficial as possible and made the women always talk about the same things, orgasms. The counts they had, the biggest object they powered with them. They never shared anything personal, never made any connections, never hugged each other. All their energy was to be saved for coming. To reach their full potential. Oh yes, they also talked about Sheryl a lot. And Hillary. And all the women they idolise like queens, which was what they literally call them. One time S tried to make a friend, but quickly realised that she had befriended S because of her high count that month, and was hoping to get a few shifts with her. Whenever S tried to bring up her feelings or reaching for help she was ignored or put in an awkward position: are you some kind of sexist? You don’t think women can make it through all of this on their own?
Don’t you believe in female empowerment?
And as she ran all these thoughts through her mind, she realised she had walked towards parts of the building she didn’t know, she had gone down the stairs to the underground levels where the servers and some of the machinery was, as well as random facilities like the laundry room and the meditation room. A few years ago, when eastern alternative medicine was in vogue, Orgasmify had set this up but it was hardly used anymore. The women had become too busy as the company grew. S had even forgotten about it if wouldn’t have been for a noise she’d heard coming from the door, oh someone is actually using the meditation room, what a fucking miracle.
The door was slightly open and S could see the warm light and soft red carpeted floor through that crack. She walked towards it and peeked inside: she couldn’t believe her eyes. It was a woman coming. A woman having an orgasm. Without anything to collect it, no Orgasmify, no nothing. She was completely naked and lied on the floor. There was incense and candles lit and the women rested her curly caramel hair on a velvet, burgundy coloured pillow. Her skin was covered in freckles and spots, like someone had drew a pattern on her skin. S was amazed, this was a sight she hadn’t seen in years. She couldn’t help but just stay there and watch this woman pleasuring herself over and over again, apparently with something inside her that could move on its own, some kind of smart vibrator, and apparently just for the sake of it.
She looked happy and vulnerable, as if giving herself completely to her body.
After a few minutes of voyeurism, S felt a tingling going through her body, she couldn’t remember the last time she felt that way. Something was urging her to come inside.
The woman was too into her own pleasure and she couldn't notice S’s presence as she stepped into the carpeted floor. And S just felt like joining her: for the first time in years, something incalculable had push her into a decision, her subjective body taken over her logic and empirical thinking. The woman was still pleasuring herself with her eyes closed, and S undressed herself and came close. She lied next to the woman and first touched her hand, so it wouldn't be an aggressive approach. She stroke the open palm of her hand and then ran her fingers through hers.
So V opened her eyes and there was this woman, naked lied next to her with olive glowing skin and charcoal black hair, looking at her as if she had found the holy grail. There was silence and neither said a word, just touched each other in every inch of their body, feeling each other’s skin with their fingertips, and then with gently kisses, until S slid her hand inside of V’s thighs, caressing her labia, taking out her strange smart dildo out of her, only to hands and fingers and licks and kisses. Neither of them looked confused, neither of them asked any questions. No rational thinking went through their brains, there was a total and complete absence of a rational brain. It was pure pleasure, nothingness.
When they got tired and their bodies gave in, they went back to lie next to each other, still naked and with a puffy breath.
Like a calm sea, they fell into a light sleep.
