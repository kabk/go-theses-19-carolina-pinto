        <p>So are these your usual evening plans? Storming in someone like this?</p>
      </p>
    </p>S felt embarrassed and confused, completely struck by this woman’s confidence. And then the guilt. The guilt that hit her like heavy rain and cold wind on your hands. The guilt that’s a shredder inside your stomach, eating your own flesh. She stood up, went around an imaginary circle and sat down again.

    <p>
      <p>
        <p>Cool vibrator, right? I just found it in the building! It has some kind of A.I shit. Pleased to make your acquaintance, I’m V.</p>
      </p>
    </p>
    S remained silent, looked down at her own bare toes, fixated in a tiny mole on her foot, eyes like glass.
    <p>
      <p>
        <p>That’s an odd reaction, you seamed to be really enjoying yourself five minutes ago</p>
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <p>
        <p>And I did. But. Orgasmify! Our count… we just wasted so much energy, probably thousands of watts. This will definitely affect my numbers tomorrow. And I hate that I feel this way about it. And it’s not even about G, it’s about the orgasms. Feel
          like I can hear fucking Sheryl preaching in my mind, about being the best version of ourselves and how lucky I am to be doing the thing I love… I just threw hours of away, for nothing. Sorry, I’m S. Orgasmify 809, in the East Wing.</p>
      </p>
    </p>
    S felt an uneasiness all through her system. Wasn't this what she wanted all along?
    <p>
      <p>
        <p>I’m V. I only started working here recently so I am feeling still a bit confused about all this, not so sure what to make of it. Tell me S, why is exactly that you think that spending time pleasuring yourself or others without being for an economic
          purpose is time wasted? Why this need of producing constantly?</p>
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <p>
        <p>Look, I’ve been here for a couple of years. I started working here with my partner, and we believe in Sheryl’s ideas, we really do. She seems to have the answer to tackle patriarchy, to become the white man, to take over the system! When she discovered Orgasmify it was such a breakthrough. I truly believed that feminism was taking over. But now, despite understanding her intentions, I don’t know anymore, I don’t think that using our bodies and pleasure for profit is doing anything to create a new way of working or collaborating, I feel us more distant and alienated than ever, but on the other hand, so much has been accomplished…</p>
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <p>
        <p>You think so much has been accomplished? Doesn’t it feel to you like this is exact same thing, only with Sheryl instead of a Mark or a Donald? What new powers came with being in the centre of power? It seems to me that this only became the white
          man capitalist dream. Endless profit.
          <p>
            <p>
              <p>I get you — and yet it’s not the same thing, right? Having a woman in such a power position as Sheryl is not the same as a Mark or a Donald… She did shine a light on equality, on all the things that women can do. And yet, there’s got to be new solutions right? New ways of thinking. One that still empowers women, but doesn't kill us working for it. I am all for women ruling, just seems that a lot of aspects weren't thought of when the opportunity to be in power came about.</p>
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <p>
              <p>Exactly. Sheryl is just repeating the same ideas: by trying to take over this system, she became it. As a so called feminist she can't comply with this neoliberal idea that we have to work until we die, even if it’s to empower women — which
                is not. It’s just producing producing producing, the fucking big idea. A fucking patriarchal, classist big idea.
                <p>
                  <p>
                    <p>What big idea, sorry?</p>
                  </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <p>
                    <p>Basically, the free market as state of mind, introduced by economist Friedrich Hayek in 1936, also known as the godfather of neoliberalism. It was Hayek who showed us how to get from the hopeless condition of human partiality to the majestic objectivity of science. Hayek’s Big Idea acts as the missing link between our subjective human nature, and nature itself. In so doing, it puts any value that cannot be expressed as a price – as the verdict of a market – on an equally unsure footing, as nothing more than opinion, preference, folklore or superstition. The problem of trying ‘to make it’, be successful, be on top, whatever you want to call it, is that is always tainted with the same way of thinking you are trying to oppose. Contemporary values of the feminist girl boss follow the same of a neoliberal, capitalist, profit driven ones: that women have to fight and work harder to achieve the same as men, to take their positions, to ‘rule the world’. The economic and labour systems we currently move in were made by and for men, valuing rationality and objectivity as the most important qualities that one should have in their professional lives, and in the current system, in all aspects of living. Why aren’t our bodily experiences being taken into account in the same way as objectivity or productivity?
                      <p>
                        <p>
                          <p>That is a big question, that probably goes way back. But is pointing fingers at Sheryl as the ‘bad feminist or fake feminist the way to move forward?</p>
                        </p>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <p>
                          <p>I am not pointing fingers at Sheryl — she is, at the end, a product of how commercialised feminism became, in so many ways of living that now we are even producing energy with our orgasms! If you’d tell me about this some years
                            ago, it would have sounded great, until you really come to the core of it. When the question of female empowerment failed to look at capitalism, we got Orgasmify. And so, this neoliberalism turns a sow's ear into a silk purse
                            by elaborating a narrative of female empowerment. Invoking the feminist critique of the family wage to justify exploitation, it harnesses the dream of women's emancipation to the engine of capital accumulation. Even Sheryl
                            would be able to see this, and using her knowledge and experience to understand the system and turn it upside down would really start to open up possibilities for new ways to to work, collaborate, and be together. S had calmed
                            down and her breathing was normal, a new energy was starting to take over her, the same that runs through trees’ roots in spring or the first waves of the high tide. She was finally able to look around the room, feel the soft
                            carpet again, stare into V’s eyes and see the whole world.
                            <p>
                              <p>
                                <p>Indeed I have been frustrated with this, this inner struggle, that question why is it that being the best woman possible is about working so hard, why is my pleasure being used like this, I’m wandering if I will ever be
                                  able to have a real orgasm again. And if I do, will I recognise it? We have been surrounded and drowned in Orgasmify so much it has became my life. And in a way I love it, in a way I don’t know what love is anymore. Do
                                  I love G or do I love Sheryl?</p>
                              </p>
                            </p>
                            V came close to her and ran her fingers through S hair, smiling.
                            <p>
                              <p>
                                <p>Now we have each other to lean on. It’s all confusing for me, too. We are going to go through it together. And with the rest of the women here — the first step is to understand we are stronger as a a whole, and throw away this horrible anxiety and paranoia eating us from inside, from having to compete against each other about who has the most powerful orgasms. Wasn’t it all about pleasure, in the first place?</p>
                              </p>
                            </p>
                            S smiled back, and picked up her watch.
                            <p>
                              <p>
                                <p>Shit, I have to run.</p>
                              </p>
                            </p>
                            She put on her clothes as fast and she could and stormed up the stairs.

                            <p></p>It was the middle of the afternoon when Sheryl parked her orgasm-powered car in front of Hillary’s house. She carried a suitcase with her plan, that wasn't very intricate: By doing more research on Reich, search through journals and personal writings, news articles and orgone sketches; it could be possible to find a way to convince the public that he was in fact, non-binary. Such claim on his gender identity would be impossible to disprove and to refute, as it is so personal and subjective in its nature. And that would eliminate the danger of praising the weaker sex.
  <p></p>It wouldn’t take away the lies that Sheryl had fostered in the minds of her clients, partners and workers.  She too, felt like a fraud. But she saw it as challenge, an opportunity to once again assert herself as the powerful, steel woman she knew she was.
  What scared her the most about this meeting was losing Hillary’s support. Since the beginning of her Presidency they have leaned on each other for help and collaborations. And this fear was frustrating to deal with.
  As Sheryl opened the door to her office, she tried to convince herself: “I’m going to Lean In like never before. I don’t need you, Hillary, and I am going to show you you’re the one that needs me.”
  They shook hands and exchange looks.
  The door closed and wouldn't open for exactly an hour.
