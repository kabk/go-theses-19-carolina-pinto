<p>In the middle of the night, on their bed, S and G laid next to each other without saying a word, even though they both knew they were awake. Insomnia had begun shortly after starting at Orgasmify, a symptom of the anxiety they experienced everyday, an uneasiness towards everyone, the nocturnals, each other, themselves. An anxiety that they were trying to fight and negate, because, after all, they were living their best lives, doing what they loved, and yet the idea of what that love was was getting more and more confusing.
Sheryl’s words echoed in their minds, the words they joined Orgasmify for: to do what you love while making women the most powerful and influential force of the country. To be strong and stable. Why would they admit that they were unhappy making a living out of producing orgasms?
S didn’t feel like she could share these feelings, mainly because she felt like they wouldn’t be welcomed. And she was angry at herself, for being so fucking selfish and ungrateful towards a company that had given the platform and the tools to become an example to follow in the feminist struggle. Even though she was surrounded by other women, she had never felt so lonely. Trying to constantly be a better version of herself, with more powerful orgasms, intense pleasure, come again and again, oh this will be a beautiful amazing one that you will love, oh but it wasn’t. Just pure exhaustion, legs shaking, hands trembling, sweat drips for the middle of your breasts, uneasiness takes over. Is that an orgasm? Guess it was another anxiety attack, it’s difficult to distinguish these two nowadays.
Perhaps the nation is running on stress and not pleasure. S wouldn’t know, she forgot how to tell them apart.
And as she looked to her side, she wondered if G was experiencing the same confusion, but it was impossible to tell, it was impossible to tell anything by her expressionless face, her determined eyes and closed mouth, like she was an impenetrable wall, a steel woman. That let’s nothing and no one break her down.
“Hey, G, are you awake?”
“Yes. Yes I am.”
“I want to say that I love you.”
“I love you too.”
“Don’t you feel that sometimes we are losing the connection with our bodies, with our minds, our emotions? That this is so called pleasure is transforming into a tool, that we are no longer nature but something outside of it, while at the same time our love and work are equivalent and we can’t even distinguish emotions and feelings anymore?”
“Stop listening to your body and start listening to your mind. You’re being sexist. Women can and should be perfectly rational too. ”
“That’s not what I was talking about!”
S felt that Sheryl had taken over G’s body, that her partner had vanished into the free market dream, no longer able to make decisions or think for her own. The same dream that assigns what is most human about human beings – our minds and our volition – to algorithms and markets, leaving us to mimic, zombie-like, the shrunken idealisations of economic models. Radically upgrading the price system into a kind of social omniscience means radically downgrading the importance of our individual capacity to reason – our ability to provide and evaluate justifications for our actions and beliefs.
Was this that Sheryl had always idealised? Is this what GRL PWR means?
As S closed her eyes and imaged G naked in their old bathtub, washing herself and covering her pink pointy nipples with rose scented foam, while smiling and calling for S to join her, she felt that it was time to answer these questions her partner no longer could help her with.
Meanwhile, on the periphery of the city, where the pace slows down and there is darkness, Sheryl and Hillary were meeting in the park.
This was the only place they could go to that would be dark enough for them not to be seen, dark enough to disable the ceaseless calling to go back to work, brought by the constant ever so bright office lights in the tall buildings, showing that not even the night could defeat the great oh so mighty strength of hard work and fulfilled potentials. In the city there is no night and there is not darkness. No sleep or rest. Only working, being awake and producing.
As soon as Sheryl crossed looks with Hillary at the distance, the tingling feeling came almost instantly. She found herself floating above the crushed leaves on the Autumn floor while making her way to her partner. Hillary was half eyed down on the floor, over a checkered blanket.
“Hello, my dear… at last, by ourselves. Please, lie down. This is a special, magical blanket, you know? Once I had a threesome with Donald and Kellyanne on this baby. Cool right? Well now that he is rotting in prison it’s even fucking cooler.”
“Wow, I had no idea about this.”
“Lovely, lovely Sheryl… there is so much about me you don’t know. So many things left to discover,  places to explore… dark, wet, deep places. Come here.” Hillary did a gesture with her index finger, indicating Sheryl to come closer. Sheryl felt hypnotised by Hillary’s energy, something that confused her as it was so outside of what she was used to, sensations she had never felt before, that she couldn't account for, a power almost alien to what her mind was used to. It was as if her brain emptied and her body was the one taking over, which seemed wrong, scary but tempting at the same time. She came closed and Hillary leaned her head in and whispered in her ear:
“Tonight I will make you come so hard you will forget who you are.” She then put her tongue out and tickled Sheryl’s ear, licking it and bitting her lobe. Sheryl’s tingling got bigger and now she wasn’t sure if it was an anxiety attack or what the fuck it was.
So she couldn't say anything, words couldn't form in her mind and the only thing that came out of her mouth was a long deep exhale and a reach for Hillary’s mouth, and they kissed. Their bodies were so close to each other it was as if Sheryl could feel Hillary’s tingling as well. Hillary buttoned down Sheryl’s shirt and reached out for her perky, firm breasts, that were swollen, with her heart beating fast and intensely underneath. Her hand continued to go down, until she reached her inner thighs from underneath Sheryl’s skirt.
Sheryl wasn’t sure if her strong heart beat was normal and that confusing her and at the same time she wanted more. It reminded her of the adrenaline of an important deadline to deliver. Or the rush that goes through her veins when she writes an angry email. Nevertheless, Hillary’s power over her was too strong and she gave in to her senses, letting herself go and succumb to the night pleasures of the magic blanket.
Just after a few minutes, the two women were both naked and had already licked each other in every surface of their bodies possible, and Sheryl’s mind began to empty slowly, and gradually she became her body. no longer there was Sheryl and Sheryl’s body, but one person, one body, feeling completely every single cell of Hillary’s touch. All of a sudden, Sheryl felt something making its way inside her, and as she looked down, Hillary was inserting a big, black vibrator in her, moving her hand and playing with the different speeds.
“This is something the Russians discovered and not even the general public has access to. top of the line, A.I sex toy. It learns your body responses even before you do, and then moulds itself to be the perfect one for you. Since you’re my special Orgasmify lady, I thought you can only have the best of the orgasms.” And as she finished her sentence, she pushed the toy further inside Sheryl, and she let out a timid moan.
Since Sheryl had started Orgasmify, she hadn’t have a single orgasm. And she almost forgot how those felt, as the only thing she was interested in knowing was how much energy could be converted in one orgasm, what was the quality, what type, how many Watts it produced. In fact, Sheryl knew all about orgasms but not how it felt like to experience one. Even though she was the CEO of Orgasmify, she never dud the actual work that the energy producers did. She had been born to be a leader, a woman boss, and had been through enough when working for Facebook, never making it to the CEO position. This was her fucking time and no one would boss her around.
And again her mind showed up, her brain took over and she could again feel the separation Sheryl and Sheryl’s body. Sheryl was starting to come back take over her body.
But then she looked at Hillary, touching herself and her at the same time, and she really wanted to come back to the ecstasy she was in just minutes ago. She closed her eyes and tried to focus on the toy moving inside her, and doing the breathing exercises she had learnt in pilates class. She reached out and touched Hillary, hoping that pleasuring her partner would take her out of her head.
After a while, Hillary had reached orgasm multiple times and still nothing in Sheryl’s body, too much in her mind.
Hillary noticed she looked strange, she had a frown of concern in her face, one that wasn't the frown of orgasmic pleasure.
“What’s wrong, my love? You don’t like my toy?”
“No, I love it, and I want you… I just… I just can’t come. I haven't had an orgasm in years.”
“What do you mean? You founded Orgasmify.”
“Yes, I know that. It seems like orgasms have been in my mind too much, I can’t turn off my work mode, they have been such a big part of my life, of my career, that when I am close to coming it is as if my brain takes over and all I can see is numbers, values, watts. I should go. Perhaps to the office. This just probably means I am stressed about this deadline coming up so I should get to it.” And Sheryl starts to get dressed.
“What? That’s crazy. Intimacy and pleasure are beautiful things. They can’t be translated into watts.” And she touched Sheryl’s leg with a soft hand.
“Yes, Hillary, they can. That’s what Orgasmify, that you helped funding, does. I can’t come, it would be too wasteful to do it for nothing. We can’t afford that. I’m sorry. You really are amazing.”
And Sheryl ran though the bushes and disappeared into the park’s darknes. The city light were waiting, she had a cause to fight for.
