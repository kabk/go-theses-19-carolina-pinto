  <div id="Abstract">
    <p>This thesis tries to investigate love and intimacy in today’s career-driven culture, through a critique of corporate feminism.
As a feminist, I see that the movement’s tendency is still to try to fit in a male discourse and body when it comes to leadership positions and power roles. This neoliberal, capitalist feminism complies with the patriarchal system it states to be against, not actively creating a change in socio-economical landscapes. It is time to make our own roles and models. I think it’s important to bring to the table issues such as love and sexuality in an age where rationality and objectivity is valued over emotions and experiences. As our “work lives” are no longer separate from our “lives”, and we are driven by all types of love, it’s important to question how does the love for work affects intimacy in a neoliberal feminism.
This research was conducted through a speculative short story, in order to create a world where the merge of work and love has gone so far and they can no longer be perceived as two things. Speculating on this reality also allowed the creation of an installation that recreates this corporate feminist “paradise”, merging spaces of worship, love and work into one.
While reflecting on different types of feminism and what do they bring to the conversation on love and work, I didn't reach a specific conclusion like I thought I would: creating a fictional world only uncovered the complexities of ourselves and our ideologies, and made me more accepting of these incongruities as richness and dialogue.
