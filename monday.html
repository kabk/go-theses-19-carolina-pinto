<p><p><p>Ladies, let’s keep these numbers up; come on, I know you can do this. This is our time, our moment: all that our great great great grandmothers have fought for, we owe this to them. I don’t want to see anyone reaching any less than their full potential. Every. Single. Day!</p></p></p>.
They hear Sheryl’s motivational speeches in the early morning, while everyone is still in bed, ready to jump back in action after a not so well slept night. The nocturnals keep them up sometimes, but their moaning has become something as usual as hearing the metro stops being said in the speaker by that lady whose voice does not seem real, you already know how she will pronounce every letter and sound.
S struggled to open her eyes, all she wanted was to stay in bed with her eyes closed. How long has it been since she’d stay in bed awake, rolling from one side to another, drifting between a light sleep and pure laziness? It’s hard to think about how that feels now.
Now that we have reached our full potentials.
She looked to the side and her partner, G, was on the other side of the bed facing back to her. She noticed how her waist and her hips formed a Lombard Street-like curve, how her hair was like a waterfall down the pillow. G’s legs moved slowly inside the duvet, letting S know she was awake. S reached for G’s hand and felt it warm, moving it towards her own breast, caressing her nipple that was getting hard. G quickly withdrew her hand and sat on the bed, still facing back to her partner.
<p><p><p>What are you doing? You know there is no time for this, we have to get up and get started.</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>You are right, there is no time.</p></p></p>
They got up, got dressed and walked towards their Orgasmify; the nocturnals were probably finishing up their shift.
The headquarters looked like the hipster start-up dream. The walls were made of glass and plants came out of ceiling, there were colourful design chairs around the hallway, like those ones you curl up to read in. It was a big building right in the city centre, with a courtyard in the middle. In the different bars and cafeterias, you could always find the finest coffee, the best fruits and detox juices. This was all, of course, to help them reach their full potential, although the leisure aspect of it made a good disguise.
It was easy to get around the place without ever needing to leave (in fact, S doesn’t remember the last time that she went for a stroll around town). Why would you? There was a lot of work to be done. Convenience and effectiveness were cherished words. Besides, this was the furthest a group of women had ever gotten in society, this is a win to celebrate! Orgasmify would be the world’s future soon, and there would be no need for strolls around the city.
Not when you make living loving.
Loving, — or coming — to be more precise.
G was sipping on an espresso went they entered the room where their Orgasmify was in. J and F, the nocturnals, were just finishing.
<p><p><p>Give us a second, please, I think J has another one until she’s finished. Ok darling, I am going to press it again, are you ready? One. Two. Three.</p></p></p>
From the Orgasmify a moan was heard, a sound that made a perfect O in J’s mouth and in the air. A heavy breathing followed, and then a ping sound, like the microwave when your food is ready.
S took in the air through her nose and inspired a deep and long sniff. As even when you capitalise everything, including this, we don’t stop being humans, we don’t stop being animals. And we smell. S took in this sniff with eyes closed, and she could feel the sex, she could smell the fluids, the countless orgasms that had been had in the past hours, the warmth of the skin, the saltiness of the sweat. It brought her back to when her and G still lived in their own little studio, before they started working together. This smell on long Sunday mornings, foggy windows and blinders half opened. This smell.
G lied down.
<p><p><p>Alright, me first? Since you’re daydreaming over there.</p></p></p>
S sat next to the orgasmify and observed her partner’s data with a robotic enthusiasm.
<p><p><p>Ok, so your levels are good, acidity alright, blood pressure maybe a little bit too high so we will put on some soothing tunes over here, muscle response is perfect, so you’re almost ready to go.</p></p></p> Pause. They looked at each other and they could feel each other’s tiredness, their love communicated by the mechanical movements with which S operated the Orgasmify that at the same time felt like the most organic thing, as if they have been doing this all their lives. When you chose a cause you believe in to put your blood, sweat and tears, the cause merges with you, you with the cause. The way they put their love to use was through Orgasmify, there was no better way.
G could sense that beyond tiredness, there was more in S’s mind. This filled G with frustration, they had everything they could ask for and were lucky enough to be selected to serve the greatest business for women empowerment today. She was giving it all of herself, and expected her partner  to do the same.
<p><p><p>What’s up with you today? First this morning, now you’re acting weird… You know how this month we have been low on our numbers, and Sheryl is counting on us. We can’t let these women down! Do I need to go through this again with you? Touch is unpredictable, it will mess up the Orgasmify and our count. Please just focus, ok?</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>I thought we started doing this because we loved each other.</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>Well, use that energy into making our love count, alright?</p></p></p>
G turned her head away and comfortably adjusted herself in the machine that would take her orgone energy into the central power accumulator, and later sold: to turn on light bulbs, to power ovens and charge phones, to make cars drive and planes fly.
Orgasmify started when Sheryl Sandberg, then COO of Facebook, decided it was time for her ultimate Lean In and was tired of only sticking to social media. For her, it was time women really took control of the world.
That’s when Sheryl discovered Wilhem Reich’s masterpiece and life long research work: the organ accumulator. In the 1940’s, Reich had designed and constructed a box-like machine that took orgasmic energy from the atmosphere and placed it in this box, concentrated for someone to take and absorve. In a time of sexual repression and the approaching war, Reich’s idea was to liberate people and societies through the power of sexual pleasure, of the orgasm. After moving to the US in the 50’s, he spur a sexual revolution in the time of beat generation. William S. Burroughs said about it the first time tried that,
	<p><p><p>When I went into the accumulator and sat down I noticed a special silence that you sometimes feel in deep woods, sometimes on a city street, a hum that is more rhythmic vibration than a sound. My skin prickled and I experienced an aphrodisiac effect similar to good strong weed. No doubt about it, orgones are as definite a force as electricity. After using the accumulator for several days my energy came back to normal. I began to eat and could not sleep more than eight hours. I was out of the post cure drag.</p></p></p>
After being imprisoned for this controversial and immoral — at the time — research, Reich’s legacy disappeared until the late 60’s when it served as an inspiration for the sexual revolution in the Summer of Love times. But the hype wasn’t long and the orgone energy had fallen into the pit of oblivion.
Until a few years ago when Sheryl stumbled upon Reich’s documents and research, and this discovery changed her life (as now we don’t refer it to career anymore) forever. After employing a series of scientists to look into the orgasmic energy and what it could bring to world, Sheryl discovered that it was finally women’s time to reach their full potential: and, most importantly, she could make big money with this.
For Sheryl, there is no better expression of feminism than having women in top positions of the corporate world, while powering it with the energy of our bodies, making it their life missions — female empowerment meets the capitalisation of bodily sensorial experience. Orgasmify was born, and Sheryl managed to take it to a top level industry, by making double the profit of other companies, since her employees were partners of one another, lived in the building, and were basically making money out of their pleasure. Isn’t that a dream?
Sheryl’s relationship with Hillary also made the business boom through governmental deals, as they were both on the same fight together, struggling to take over the system, put women on the top. They were on very good terms with each other, and shared more than just common ideals. Their help to each other comes in forms of lobbying, trade unions forming, big investments, partnership laws and orgasms.

S and G reached about one hundred orgasms together and their count for the day was average. S was feeling exhausted and thought about bubble baths when the sun is setting and the bathroom white tiles turn orange.
<p><p><p>We have to make this work better tomorrow, if the other couples are doing better we will hear from Sheryl.</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>Don’t you want to, maybe… take a day off?</p></p></p>
<p><p><p>Sorry, what? We are already getting off all the time.</p></p></p>
S and G were hired by Orgasmify but still worked on a freelancing sort of way, a business model that Sheryl had adopted to increase the productivity and competitiveness amongst the workers. Orgasmify believed in the power of our individuality in the sense that when we are responsible for our own path, women are able to really reach our full potential, for ourselves. To Lean In is to rely on yourself because you trust in our power, in this case, quite literally. For millennia women were denied the chance and opportunity to compete in business and governmental positions, to reach higher levels of leadership — now that we have reached our full potential, it was time for women to step up, to finally take what is theirs: and not just ask for it. Having the company functioning by partners that work together and at the same time compete against other couples created an atmosphere of ambitiousness that Sheryl wished for all women in the world. If they did well and came a lot, they would feel fulfilled sexually, emotionally and professionally.
At last, the circle is closed.

S let her self fall on her back into their bed and passed her fingers lightly through her stomach, felt the inside of her belly button and then down stroking her pubic hair while going deeper until she
could feel her labia. She just kept her fingers there without moving them, warming her hand. By the time she had taken her third deep breath, her eyes were closed and she fell asleep.
