    <p>Ladies, let’s keep these numbers up; come on, I know you can do this. This is our time, our moment: all that our great great great grandmothers have fought for, we owe this to them. I don’t want to see anyone reaching any less than their full potential. Every. Single. Day!</p>

    They hear Sheryl’s motivational speeches in the early morning, whilst in bed, ready to jump back in action after a not so well slept night. The nocturnals keep them up sometimes, but their moaning has become something as usual as hearing that lady whose voice does not seem real saying the metro stops in the speaker, you already know how she will pronounce every letter and sound.
Sheryl continues:
    <p>

      <p>Remember what I always say, the answer is stay in the workforce. Try to repeat this one with me ‘I will stay in the workforce, I will stay in workforce no matter what’.</p>
      And then she said the last part, the one she repeated every day, with no exception:
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>
            <p>And I hope that you - yes, you - have the ambition to lean in to your career and run the world. Because the world needs you to change it.</p>
          </p>
        </p>
      </p>
      She would say this in a different tone of voice, after a long pause and in a slow, calm, and one would almost say, patronising way. S struggled to open her eyes, all she wanted was to stay in bed with her eyes closed. How long has it been since she’d
      stay in bed awake, rolling from one side to another, drifting between a light sleep and pure laziness? It’s hard to think about how that feels now. Now that we have reached our full potentials. She looked to the side and her partner, G, was on the
      other side of the bed facing back to her. She noticed how her waist and her hips formed a Lombard Street-like curve, how her hair was like a waterfall down the pillow. G’s legs moved slowly inside the duvet, letting S know she was awake. S reached
      for G’s hand and felt it warm, moving it towards her own breast, caressing her nipple that was getting hard. G quickly withdrew her hand and sat on the bed, still facing back to her partner.
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>
            <p>What are you doing? Save this energy for the Orgasmify, we have to get up and get started.</p>
          </p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>
            <p>You are right, the energy…</p>
          </p>
        </p>
      </p>
      They got up, got dressed and walked towards their Orgasmify; the nocturnals were probably finishing up their shift. The headquarters looked like the hipster start-up dream. The walls were made of glass and plants came out of ceiling, there were colourful designer chairs throughout the hallway, like the ones you curl up to read in. It was a big building right in the city centre, with a courtyard in the middle. In the different bars and cafeterias, you could always find the finest coffee, the best fruits and detox juices.
This was all, of course, to help them reach their full potential.
It was easy to get around the place without ever needing to leave. Why would you? There was a lot of work to be done. Convenience and effectiveness were cherished words. Besides, this was the furthest a group of women had ever gotten in society, this was a win to celebrate! Orgasmify would be the world’s future soon, and there would be no need for strolls around the city.
Not when you make a living loving.
Loving, — or coming — to be more precise.
G was sipping on an espresso when they entered the room where their Orgasmify was in. She had developed a caffeine addiction that meant she was absolutely unbearable before the black liquid entered her veins. After the third espresso she could start communicating. If she wasn't on the Orgasmify working, she was getting coffee. S had started to think that the tiny glass cup had become an extension of G’s arm.
Each room featured a quote at the door by what Sheryl referred to as “inspirational women”: people like Hillary, Oprah or Meryl Streep. Mostly quotes by herself, though.
Hanging in the door that opens to G and S’s Orgasmify room rested a wood plate, with a fake worn-out finish and calligraphic style letters:
<p>Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you.</p>
How appropriate.
J and F, the nocturnals, were just finishing.

      <p>
        <p>
          <p>Give us a second, please, I think J has to come one more time until she’s finished. Ok darling, I am going to press it again, are you ready? One. Two. Three.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      A moan coming from the Orgasmify invaded everyone’s ears, a sound that made a perfect O in J’s mouth and in the air. A heavy breathing followed, and then a ping sound, like the microwave when your food is ready.
S took in the air through her nose and inspired a deep and long sniff.

Even when we capitalise everything, when we make profit out of orgasms, when we lay all your love in we work, we don’t stop being humans, we don’t stop being animals, hungry for flesh, driven by instinct. And we smell. S inhaled with eyes closed, and she could feel the sex, she could smell the fluids, the countless orgasms that had been had in the past hours, the warmth of the skin, the saltiness of the sweat. It brought her back to when her and G still lived in their own little studio, before they started working together. This smell on long Sunday mornings, foggy windows and blinders half opened. This smell.
 G lied down.
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>Alright, me first? Since you’re daydreaming over there.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      S sat next to the Orgasmify and observed her partner’s data with a forced enthusiasm.



          <p>Ok, so your levels are good, acidity alright, blood pressure maybe a little bit too high so we will put on some soothing tunes over here, muscle response is perfect, so you’re almost ready to go.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      Pause. They looked at each other and they could feel each other’s energy, their love communicated by the mechanical movements with which S operated the Orgasmify, that at the same time felt like the most organic thing, as it does when you familiarise yourself with your routine so much your body performs as one autonomous machine, your head no longer in the space, you’re looking at yourself from above, floating. As if they had been doing this all their lives.
      When you chose a cause you believe in to put your blood, sweat and tears, the cause merges with you, you with the cause. The way they put their love to use was through Orgasmify, there was no better way.
      <p></p>
      G could sense that beyond tiredness, there was more in S’s mind. This filled G with frustration, they had everything they could ask for and were lucky enough to be in the forefront of women empowerment. She was giving it all of herself, and expected her partner to do the same. Sometimes her partner’s laziness felt like a betrayal. G took their love very seriously.

          <p>What’s up with you today? First this morning, now you’re acting weird… You know how this month we have been low on our numbers, and Sheryl is counting on us. We can’t let these women down! Do I need to go through this again with you? Touch is unpredictable, it creates different waves of pleasures, it makes the body respond in a roller coaster type of way, and it will mess up the Orgasmify and our count. Please just focus, ok?</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>I thought we started doing this because we loved it.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>Well, use that energy into making love count, alright?</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      G turned her head away, closed the small doors and comfortably adjusted herself in the machine that would take her orgone energy into the central power accumulator, and later sold: to turn on light bulbs, to power ovens and charge phones, to make cars
      drive and planes fly.
      <p></p>Orgasmify started when Sheryl Sandberg, then COO of Facebook, decided it was time for her ultimate Lean In, and stop protecting the weaker sex. For her, it was time women really took control of the world.
That’s when Sheryl discovered Wilhem Reich’s masterpiece and life long research work: the orgone accumulator. In the 1940’s, the Austrian psychoanalyst had designed and constructed a machine that absorbed the energy from orgasms. Reich believed this energy was present in the atmosphere and could be absorbed in order to heal the patient of various illnesses and problems. The patient and user of the orgone simply had to step in the accumulator, (that consisted of a rectangular box the size of a dressing room and with a chair inside) put on a strange looking triangular hat, and sit inside waiting for the mind and the body to take in the healing energy of orgasms. In a time of sexual repression and approaching war, Reich’s idea was to liberate people and societies through the power of sexual pleasure, of the orgasm, since he believed that sexual frustration fostered empathy, and empathy paved way for totalitarianism.  After moving to the US in the 1950’s, he spured a sexual revolution. Many famous American avant-garde minds used the organ accumulator. William S. Burroughs said about it the first time tried that,
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>When I went into the accumulator and sat down I noticed a special silence that you sometimes feel in deep woods, sometimes on a city street, a hum that is more rhythmic vibration than a sound. My skin prickled and I experienced an aphrodisiac
            effect similar to good strong weed. No doubt about it, orgones are as definite a force as electricity. After using the accumulator for several days my energy came back to normal. I began to eat and could not sleep more than eight hours. I
            was out of the post cure drag.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      After being imprisoned for this, at the time, controversial and immoral research, Reich’s machine disappeared. But the hype wasn’t long and the orgone energy had fallen into the pit of oblivion.
  	Until a few years ago, when Sheryl stumbled upon Reich’s documents and research, and this discovery changed her life forever. She employed a series of scientists to look into the orgasmic energy and what it could bring to the world. Sheryl knew that it was finally women’s time to reach their full potential: and, most importantly, she could make big money with this.
  And so after reconstructing Reich’s plans, building new machines with slicker, more appealing design, Orgasmify was born.
 <p></p>
 For Sheryl, there is no better expression of feminism than having women in top positions of the corporate world. Sheryl truly believes that the main issue in the world, and the one she wants to change, is that there are not enough CEO women in the top Fortune 500. When women can take control of the businesses, they can take control of what people buy, the tools they use, the way they live their lives. Orgasmify’s mission is to take women to the top, high up in the sky like the sun, shining a light on the world, while powering it with the energy of our bodies and making it their life missions.
Female empowerment meets the capitalisation of bodily sensorial experience.
<p></p>
People had long forgotten about the original organ accumulator, so Sheryl had the chance to construct the history that best suited the times we are on today. To add her own alternative facts regarding not only the machine’s origin, but most importantly, its inventor.
The weaker gender shall not be praised.
With a new organ accumulator rebuilt and designed, Sheryl presented Orgasmify to the world.
The form was similar to its original concept: a dressing-room sized box, but only this one was vulva shaped, a thin oval that opened the doors that were the labia. The little window for partner interaction was just at the top, in the clitoris — as women should always be at the top and in the centre of pleasure (and profit). The energy was collected through the chair, that had an elevation where the middle of your legs would be.
Sheryl managed to take the company to the top, by making double the profit of other companies, since her employees were partners of one another, lived in the building, and were basically making money out of their pleasure. What a dream. Sheryl’s relationship with the country’s President also made the business boom through governmental deals, as they were both on the same fight together, towards women empowerment and leadership. They helped each other with lobbying, trade unions forming, big investments, partnership laws and orgasms.
<p></p>
S and G reached the expected amount of orgasms together, with an average intensity overall. S was feeling exhausted and thought about bubble baths when the sun is setting and the white bathroom tiles turn orange.

          <p>We have to make this work better tomorrow. If the other couples are doing better, our rankings will for sure suffer.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>Don’t you want to, maybe… take a day off?</p>
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>
          <p>Sorry, what? We are already getting off all the time.</p>
        </p>
      </p>
    <p></p>  G often snapped with answers as bitter as her coffee, with tense highbrows and stiff neck, laying one more brick in the wall she was building around her.
    S and G were hired by Orgasmify but still worked as freelancers, a business model that Sheryl had adopted to increase the productivity and competitiveness amongst the workers.
	Orgasmify believed in the power of individuality in the sense that, when responsible for their own path, women are able to really reach full potential, for themselves. To Lean In is to rely on yourself because you trust in your power, in this case, quite literally. For millennia women were denied the chance and opportunity to compete in business and governmental positions, to reach higher levels of leadership — now that we have reached our full potential, it is time for women to step up, to finally take what is theirs: and not just ask for it. Having the company functioning by partners that work together and at the same time compete against other couples created an atmosphere of ambitiousness that Sheryl wished for all women in the world. If they did well and came a lot, they would feel fulfilled sexually, emotionally and professionally.
At last, the circle is closed.
<p></p>
S let herself fall on her back into their bed and passed her fingers lightly through her stomach, felt the inside of her belly button and then down stroking her pubic hair while going deeper until she
could feel her labia. She just kept her fingers there without moving them, warming her hand. In days fuelled with achievements and high performance (all of them were), S seemed to crave feelings and sensations anywhere she could find them. She needed to wake the numbness up. By the time she had taken her third deep breath, her eyes were closed and she fell asleep.
